Problem: A Robot positioned at the entry point of a maze will have to find its way to the exit point. 
Task: Write an algorithm to achieve this. A sample maze is given below.
Maze Encoding: Treat this maze as a two dimensional array of size mXn having values 1 or 0. The robot can move only along 1s and stops on getting a zero in the cell ahead. "Ahead" means the next cell along the moving direction.
Input: x,y the entry cell coordinate where the robot is stationed
Basic Robot Commands: 

Right to turn right
Left to turn left
Turn for about turn
Move moves ahead
Write(x) writes x in the current cell
Read reads the current cell value
Any other primitive which you deem fit
