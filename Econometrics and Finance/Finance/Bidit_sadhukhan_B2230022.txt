The points I have found out about the different kind of interest rate is as follows:

Fixed-Rate Loan:

- Stable Interest: A fixed-rate loan maintains a consistent interest rate throughout the loan term.
- Predictable Payments: Borrowers can expect uniform monthly payments, aiding budgeting.
- Low Risk: Suitable for risk-averse individuals who prefer steady payments and protection against interest rate hikes.
  
Variable-Rate Loan:

- Initial Savings: Variable-rate loans often start with lower interest rates, resulting in lower initial monthly payments.
- Uncertainty: Interest rates can fluctuate, increasing the risk of higher monthly payments if rates rise.
- Risk-Tolerant Choice: Suitable for those comfortable with uncertainty and seeking potential cost savings when rates remain low.
  
Hybrid Loan (Mixture of Both):

- Balanced Approach: Combines fixed and variable rates, offering initial stability followed by potential savings.
- Risk Management: Provides a safety net with fixed rates and flexibility with variable rates.
- Customizable: Allows borrowers to adapt to changing financial circumstances and interest rate environments.

 Fixed-rate loans provide stability, variable-rate loans offer potential savings but with more risk, and hybrid loans balance both aspects.So considering all the points and me being a risk taker would potentially go for the variable rate since I think there is a bit of uncertainty that the loan interest may be lesser than the fixed rate and may also be lesser for the total interest paid in the long run.
